<details><summary>9.0.0 - 25 April 2023</summary>

### About
**Important:** This version features a number of changes to Unprompted's syntax that may break existing templates. Please see the latest announcement for more details.

### Added
- Block shortcodes can now implement `preprocess_block()` which allows them to take priority over any inner shortcodes
- `[if]`, `[else]`, `[elif]`, `[do]`, `[for]`, `[while]`, `[repeat]`, `[switch]`: now utilize `preprocess_block()` such that you no longer have to write secondary shortcode tags for nested statements
- `[choose]`: utilizes the new `preprocess_block()` to temporarily replace the value of `Unprompted.Config.sanitize_after` to `{"\\n":"|"}` which should allow the following syntax to select a random line from another file: `[choose][file some_file][/choose]`
- `[chance]`, `[do]`, `[for]`, `[while]`, `[set]`: now sanitize the content per the new `Unprompted.Config.syntax.sanitize_block` rules
- `[chance]`, `[do]`, `[for]`, `[while]`, `[set]`: support `_raw` to disable content sanitization
- New function `shortcode_var_is_true()`: allows shortcodes to check if a given variable key is found in pargs or set to True in kwargs (still needs to be implemented across most shortcodes)
- `[sets]`: supports advanced expressions
- Unprompted now includes extra generation paramters in the output window
- You can disable the above behavior by setting `Unprompted.Config.stable_diffusion.show_extra_generation_params` to false
- New config setting `Unprompted.Config.log_contexts`: a comma-delimited string that dictates which types of log messages to include in the console (only shows `ERROR` and `RESULT` messages by default, but can be extended to show `DEBUG` or `ALL`)
- Debug message displaying startup load time
- Simple `unprompted_dry.bat` that activates a given conda environment and launches `unprompted_dry.py` (you will need to edit it for your own setup)

### Changed
- `[zoom_enhance]`: fixed bug with manual mask behavior
- `[zoom_enhance]`: updated Wizard shortcode generation for compatibility with new syntax
- `[get]`: the `_before` and `_after` arguments no longer update the variable's stored value
- Bodysnatcher: updated template for compatibility with new syntax
- img2img_folder: updated template for compatibility with new syntax
- txt2img2img: update template for compatibility with new syntax
- Fixed an issue that prevented `controlnet_x_pixel_perfect` variables from working correctly
- Moved `import` calls of various Stable Diffusion shortcodes into the `run()` block to prevent issues with the standalone `unprompted_dry.py`

### Removed
- `Unprompted.Config.debug` in favor of the new `Unprompted.Config.log_contexts`
- Shortcodes that allow nested statements without use of secondary shortcode tags will no longer parse those secondary tags, unfortunately this means some templates will have to be updated for compatibility
- Outdated `choose_weighted` example template

<details><summary>👴🏼 Older Versions</summary>
<details><summary>8.3.1 - 22 April 2023</summary>

### About

Over the last couple days, I have been experimenting with changes to the adaptive scaling features of `[zoom_enhance]`. I believe it will produce more consistent results across different resolutions, but you should take a backup of the current shortcode if you're happy with its performance - many of the default settings have changed, and I will likely continue finetuning it over the next few weeks. Your feedback is appreciated!

### Changed
- `[zoom_enhance]`: rewrote most of the adaptive scaling calculations
- `[zoom_enhance]`: introduced several try-catch blocks for better exception handling
- `[zoom_enhance]`: fixed a couple issues with `show_original`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: fixed an issue that caused the shortcode to call Unprompted's `process()` routine a second time

</details>

<details><summary>8.3.0 - 21 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- New shortcode `[color_correct]`: provides the same automatic color grading features as Bodysnatcher, but in the form of a standalone block
- `[color_correct]`: supports the `source` argument, which is a string that processes the initial image with `[txt2mask]` and uses the resulting masked image as a source for color correction, as opposed to the entire image
- `[txt2mask]`: implemented [CLIP Surgery](https://github.com/xmed-lab/CLIP_Surgery) as a new method type ("clip_surgery") which optionally supports Segment Anything (dev comment: this is better than `clipseg` at certain tasks but worse at others - `clipseg` is still default for the time being)
- `[txt2mask]`: new argument `stamp` that pastes a temporary PNG onto the init image before running mask processing, useful for redacting a portion of the image for example
- `[txt2mask]`: supports `stamp_method` to choose sizing and positioning logic
- `[txt2mask]`: supports `stamp_x` and `stamp_y` for precise positioning of the stamp
- `[txt2mask]`: supports `stamp_blur` radius to engage optional gaussian filter
- `[txt2mask]`: 10 basic stamps are included by default
- `[zoom_enhance]`: now supports `mask_method`
- `[template]`: any kwargs in the Wizard template block will be passed to the constructed `[file]` block
- `[file]`: experimental new argument `_bypass_if` that skips file processing if the value returns true (intended to be used with Wizard templates)
- `[get sd_model]` should now work as expected
- Bodysnatcher: new option `background_mode` that inverts the mask and disables the zoom_enhance step
- Bodysnatcher: new setting `stamp`

### Changed
- `[zoom_enhance]`: the `color_correct_method` default value is now `none`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: fix for adaptive CFG scaling
- `[zoom_enhance]`: minor tweaks to the adaptive scaling algorithm
- `[zoom_enhance]`: speculative fix for an issue with batch processing, which may also resolve an infinite loop that could occur with Bodysnatcher
- `[txt2mask]`: the "sam" `method` has been renamed to "grounded_sam"
- `[txt2mask]`: fixed a crash related to switching back and forth between `method` types
- Moved legacy shortcodes into their own `legacy` folder
- Fixed a crash related to empty shortcode arguments
- Updated the manual

</details>

<details><summary>8.2.0 - 18 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- `[substring]`: you can now pass strings into the `start` and `end` arguments and it will find the index of those strings within the content
- `[zoom_enhance]`: included `negative_mask` in the Wizard UI

### Changed
- `[txt2mask]`: setting `method="sam"` will attempt to install the required GroundingDINO library automatically, YMMV
- `[array]`: fixed crash related to `_shuffle`
- Unprompted will now store downloaded models into `models` rather than `lib_unprompted`
- On startup, Unprompted will move its models to the new location

</details>

<details><summary>8.1.0 - 17 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- You can now use `[set]` to manage various ControlNet settings
- Bodysnatcher: new setting `use_optimized_inference_settings`
- Bodysnatcher: new setting `use_controlnet_preset`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: implements the `color-matcher` library for higher quality swaps
- `[zoom_enhance]`: supports `color_correct_method` to choose from different grading algorithms, or disable color correction by setting this to `none`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: supports `color_correct_strength` which is an integer that determines how many times to run the `color_correct_method`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: the `adaptive_hires` feature will now ajdust CFG scale and apply a bit of sharpening
- Wizard UI `number` elements can now specify `_minimum` and `_maximum` value range (however, this isn't supported by Gradio yet)
- Specified default values for Wizard UI `slider` elements to prevent crashing

### Changed
- `[zoom_enhance]`: speculative fix for final image not showing up in the output window
- `[zoom_enhance]`: the `use_workaround` parg has been renamed to `show_original`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: hotfix for broken txt2img mode
- `[case]`: fixed an issue with default case always firing
- Bodysnatcher: decreased the default value of `zoom_enhance_denoising_max` from 0.35 to 0.30
- Bodysnatcher: debug images are no longer saved by default, but you can toggle them in the UI

</details>

<details><summary>8.0.0 - 16 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- New `Bodysnatcher` GUI template
- New option `Unprompted.Config.beta_features` to opt into unfinished doodads
- Unprompted now creates a copy of the `p` object at the beginning of the `process()` routine named `Unprompted.p_copy`, which allows for greater compatibility with extensions that hijack the inference pipeline (e.g. ControlNet)
- With the help of the above change, `[zoom_enhance]` is now compatible with ControlNet
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now applies a sharpening filter to the final image as determined by the `sharpen_amount` arg
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports manual mask behavior `mode` similar to `[txt2mask]`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode seeks to improve support with `Only Masked` mode by scaling up some settings to account for your original image resolution
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode supports `bypass_adaptive_hires` to disable the above behavior
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports `hires_size_max` which limits the adaptive resolution to avoid OOM errors (defaults to 1024)
- Wizard Templates now support `[wizard_ui_accordion]` to group a collection of settings into a collapsible menu
- Wizard Template UI elements now support `_info` for showing descriptive text
- New `Known Issues` section in the manual
- The `[txt2mask]` shortcode now supports the Segment Anything Model with GroundingRINO (set `method="sam"`), although you need to install the latter manually--it doesn't work with pip at the time of writing--and I'm not particularly impressed by its results compared to clipseg (after installing manually: you'll need to move GroundingRINO into your `venv` folder and replace any `import groundingrino` calls with relative imports e.g. `import ...utils.something`)
- CSS style for prose hyperlinks so I can actually see the darn things

### Changed
- Wizard Functions have been renamed to Wizard Templates
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now runs the native `process_images_inner()` function as opposed to piggybacking the `[img2img]` shortcode
- The `[zoom_enhance]` `save` parg has been renamed to `debug`

- A bit of UI polish
- Fixed a crash related to calling `Unprompted.parse_alt_tags()` with an empty string
- Fixed typo related to Wizard Template radio buttons
- Fixed CSS padding of list elements in the latest version of WebUI
- Fixed CSS spacing between `<detail>` elements
- Fixed Wizard Template radio button default value
- Fixed an issue with nested Wizard UI event listeners
- Wizard UI values are updated on Gradio's unfocus event due to the unreliable nature of the `change()` event as demonstrated here: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/3876
- Improved logging in various places
- Wizard Templates are now explicitly loaded as `utf8` (compatible with emoji 😎)

### Removed
- The `settings` placeholder UI files for the time being, although I would like to implement a UI for `config_user.json` eventually

- New `[txt2mask]` setting `unload_model` to disable the above behavior
- The `[zoom_enhance]` Wizard UI now includes `unload_model`
- New `[zoom_enhance]` setting `upscale_method`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` default upscaling method is now Nearest Neighbor which should result in a more accurate final image

- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports `mask_sort_method` which determines the order of multiple matching regions, defaults to `left-to-right`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode will now adjust CFG scale dynamically, in the same fashion as denoising strength
- The `[zoom_enhance]` Wizard GUI now lets you override `denoising_strength` and `cfg_scale` with arbitary values, bypassing the "dynamic" mechanism

<details><summary>7.5.9 - 15 February 2023</summary>

### About

The `[controlnet]` shortcode is now considered a "legacy" feature as it is generally less robust than [Mikubill's dedicated ControlNet extension](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet).

### Removed
- The `[repeat]` shortcode no longer supports `_times` as the first argument now automatically accepts expressions and secondary shortcode tags
- The `[switch]` shortcode no longer supports `_var` as the first argument now automatically accepts expressions and secondary shortcode tags

> **Important Note:** the change to secondary shortcode tags will unfortunately break some existing templates. In general, I try to avoid making such changes, but in this case it was the best way to get secondary tags to interact well with advanced expressions - the <> characters conflicted with less-than, greater-than conditional checks. On the plus side, we can now do stuff like this: [if "{file some_script} < 2"]print me[/if]. Should be quite powerful!

> If you wish to revert this behavior (not recommended) you can do so by creating a file called config_user.json, setting advanced_expressions to false, tag_start_alt to <, and tag_start_end to >. Refer to config.json for exact formatting. Be aware that these changes will break advanced expressions.
